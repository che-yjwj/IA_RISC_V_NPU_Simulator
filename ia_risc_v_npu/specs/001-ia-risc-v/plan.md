# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]


**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
This document outlines the implementation plan for an IA-based RISC-V+NPU Adaptive Simulator. The primary goal is to create a high-speed simulator (12-20 MIPS) that is 50-200x faster than traditional cycle-accurate simulators. The technical approach involves a hybrid model with two fidelity levels: a fast, hook-based Level 0 for most instructions and a more accurate, event-based Level 1 for critical sections, implemented in Python using asyncio, NumPy, and Numba for performance.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11
**Primary Dependencies**: asyncio, NumPy, Numba, pytest
**Storage**: N/A
**Testing**: pytest, pytest-benchmark
**Target Platform**: Linux server
**Project Type**: Single project (CLI tool)
**Performance Goals**: 12-20 MIPS, 50-200x faster than cycle-accurate simulators.
**Constraints**: Accuracy within ±15%, Memory usage < 4GB.
**Scale/Scope**: MVP in 3 months.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 2 (simulator library, tests)
- Using framework directly? Yes
- Single data model? Yes
- Avoiding patterns? Yes

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? Yes
- Libraries listed: `ia_risc_v_npu` (simulator)
- CLI per library: Yes, planned
- Library docs: Planned

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes, TDD will be followed.
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Yes, this will be enforced.
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes
- Real dependencies used? N/A
- Integration tests for: new libraries, contract changes, shared schemas? Yes
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase. Yes

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? Yes, planned.
- Frontend logs → backend? N/A
- Error context sufficient? Yes, planned.

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? Yes, v1.0
- BUILD increments on every change? Yes, planned.
- Breaking changes handled? N/A for MVP.

**Structure Decision**: Option 1: Single project

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh gemini` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base.
- Generate tasks from the 12-week development roadmap in `prd.md`.
- For each week, create tasks for the specified features and goals.
- Create tasks for implementing the data models from `data-model.md`.
- Create tasks for implementing the CLI from `contracts/cli.md`.
- Create tasks for writing unit, integration, and performance tests as described in the `prd.md`.

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation.
- Dependency order: Core engine and data models first, then CLI and NPU features.
- The tasks will be ordered according to the 12-week plan in the `prd.md`.

**Estimated Output**: A detailed `tasks.md` file with tasks for each of the 12 weeks of development.

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
