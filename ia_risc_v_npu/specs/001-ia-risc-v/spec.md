# Feature Specification: IA-based RISC-V+NPU Hybrid Simulator

**Feature Branch**: `001-ia-risc-v`
**Created**: 2025-09-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "IA 기반 RISC-V+NPU 하이브리드 시뮬레이터 핵심 기능을 실시간 협업 개발로 3개월 MVP 완성. 기존 사이클 정확 시뮬레이터의 속도 한계 극복. Instruction Accurate RISC-V와 타이밍훅과 이벤트 기반의 npu와 bus, 계층 메모리로 구성."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want to use a hybrid simulator to overcome the speed limitations of traditional cycle-accurate simulators, allowing me to efficiently develop and test AI applications on a RISC-V and NPU architecture.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a compiled AI model and application code, **When** I run the simulation, **Then** the simulator executes the RISC-V instructions accurately and models the NPU behavior based on events and timing hooks.
2. **Given** a simulation is running, **When** I pause the simulation, **Then** I can inspect the state of the RISC-V core, NPU, bus, and memory.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the interaction between the RISC-V core and NPU creates a deadlock?
- How does the system handle memory access conflicts between the CPU and NPU?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The simulator MUST provide an Instruction Accurate (IA) simulation of a RISC-V processor.
- **FR-002**: The simulator MUST model the behavior of an NPU using an event-based architecture with timing hooks.
- **FR-003**: The simulator MUST model a bus architecture for communication between the RISC-V core and the NPU.
- **FR-004**: The simulator MUST model a hierarchical memory system.
- **FR-005**: The simulator's performance MUST be significantly faster than a traditional cycle-accurate simulator. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the target performance improvement? e.g., 10x, 100x?]
- **FR-006**: The simulator MUST be developed as an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) within 3 months.
- **FR-007**: The development process MUST support real-time collaboration. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What specific tools or processes are required for real-time collaboration?]


### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **RISC-V Core**: Represents the state of the processor, including registers and program counter.
- **NPU**: Represents the state of the Neural Processing Unit, including its internal registers and execution status.
- **Bus**: Represents the communication channel between the RISC-V Core and the NPU.
- **Memory**: Represents the hierarchical memory system, including caches and main memory.
- **Event**: Represents an action or occurrence within the NPU or bus, used to trigger state changes.
- **Timing Hook**: A mechanism to allow external code to be executed at specific points in the simulation time.
